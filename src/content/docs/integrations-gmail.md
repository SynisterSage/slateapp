# Gmail Sync (Integrations)

Gmail integration allows SlateApp to detect recruiter messages, sync threads, and surface actions related to applications.

## Connect Gmail

- Go to Settings → Integrations and click Connect Gmail. Follow the Google OAuth flow and grant the requested scopes.
- After connecting, the app will scan recent threads and surface messages related to your applications.

## Privacy & Tokens

- Tokens are stored securely server-side. For increased safety we use short-lived tokens and refresh tokens on the server.
- You can revoke access from Google or from Settings at any time.

## Troubleshooting

- If messages are not appearing, re-run sync from Settings or check that the account connected matches the one used for recruiter communications.
