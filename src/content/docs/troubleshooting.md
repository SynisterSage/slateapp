# Troubleshooting & FAQ

Common problems and solutions.

## Parsing errors

- If parsing fails, re-export your resume to PDF and re-upload. If errors persist, use the editor to correct fields.

## Gmail sync not showing messages

- Ensure the connected account is the same one recruiters use. Re-run sync from Settings.

## Apply flow failures

- Check that your resume file is still available and not too large. For attachments, prefer PDF.
