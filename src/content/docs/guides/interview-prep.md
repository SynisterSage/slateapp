# Interview Preparation Checklist

Use this checklist to prepare for technical and behavioral interviews.

## Before the interview

- Research the company and role; prepare 3–5 questions to ask the interviewer.
- Review the job description and map your experience to the required skills.

## Technical prep

- Practice common algorithms and system-design patterns. Do 3–5 timed problems before interviews.
- Prepare short stories demonstrating technical impact (what you built, tradeoffs, results).

## Behavioral prep

- Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure answers.
- Highlight teamwork, conflict resolution, and decision-making examples.
