# Resume Writing Best Practices

This guide covers practical tips to make your resume clear, concise, and achievement-focused.

## Structure

- Header: name, email, location, and one-line summary/role.
- Experience: list roles in reverse chronological order. For each role, include 3–6 bullets focused on impact.

## Writing bullets

- Lead with an action verb and include measurable outcomes where possible (e.g., "Reduced onboarding time by 30%").
- Keep bullets to one or two lines. Prioritize the most relevant tasks and outcomes for the role you're applying to.

## Formatting

- Use consistent dates and formatting. Prefer plain, readable fonts and avoid dense paragraphs.
- For technical roles, include a short skills section with languages, frameworks, and tools.

## Quick checklist

1. One-line summary matches the job title.
2. Top bullets show impact and metrics.
3. No spelling mistakes; run a quick spell-check.
