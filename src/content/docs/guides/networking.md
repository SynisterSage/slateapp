## Basic outreach template

Hi [Name],

I’m [Your Name], a [Role] with experience in [area]. I’m interested in [Company/Team] and wondered if you had a few minutes for a quick chat about opportunities.

## Best practices

- Personalize the first sentence and reference a mutual connection or recent company news.
- Keep messages short (3–4 sentences) and end with a single call to action.
