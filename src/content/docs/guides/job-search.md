# Effective Job Search Workflow

This guide outlines a repeatable workflow to find roles, track applications, and follow up.

## Search & discovery

- Use targeted keywords and company names. Save interesting roles to your tracking list.

## Apply consistently

- Prepare a short cover note tailored to the role. Attach the resume version optimized for that job.
- Track application date, contacts, and next follow-up in your Applications dashboard.

## Follow-up

- If you haven't heard back in 7–10 days, send a polite follow-up referencing the role and your interest.

## Prioritize

- Spend 60% of your time on roles you are most qualified for and 40% on stretch opportunities that help you grow.
