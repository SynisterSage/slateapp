# Jobs: Search & Apply

The Jobs page aggregates results from configured providers and helps you find relevant roles.

## Search

- Use the search box to look for titles, companies, or keywords. Use filters to narrow locations and job types.
- The AI match score appears on each job card to indicate relevance to your profile.

## Job Card Actions

- Save: Bookmark jobs to review later.
- Apply: Start the Apply flow. Select a resume and optionally a cover letter template.

## Quick Apply

- Quick apply from the Dashboard or Jobs list will prefill your most used resume and send the application. Review the confirmation modal before sending.

## Provider Notes

- We aggregate jobs from Muse, Adzuna, Remotive and other providers you configure. Provider caching reduces latency but may reflect short delays in live updates.
