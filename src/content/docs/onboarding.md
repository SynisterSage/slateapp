# Onboarding & First Steps

Welcome! This onboarding guide walks you through the first steps to get effective results from SlateApp.

## 1) Create your account & verify email

- Click Sign up and follow the email verification link. Verification ensures you can use integrations that require callbacks.

## 2) Upload a resume

- Navigate to Resumes → Upload Resume. Supported formats: PDF, DOCX.
- We parse your resume and extract structured fields like experience, education, and skills. Expect a short processing delay for large files.

## 3) Review parsed data

- After upload, open the resume in the editor. Check that the contact block, job titles, dates, and bullets were parsed correctly.
- Use the editor to correct any parsing errors — changes update your profile and improve job matching.

## 4) Configure job preferences

- In Settings set your desired job title, locations and notification preferences — these drive match relevance and alerts.

## 5) Find jobs

- Use the Jobs page to search, apply filters, and review AI-curated matches.
- Use the 'Find Jobs' quick action on the Dashboard to start exploring results.

## 6) Connect Gmail (optional)

- If you use Gmail to communicate with recruiters, connect Gmail under Settings → Integrations for automatic tracking of application threads.

## Tips

- Keep resumes concise and use bullet points; structured data improves AI suggestions.
- Enable analytics if you want better personalization; you can opt out in Settings.
