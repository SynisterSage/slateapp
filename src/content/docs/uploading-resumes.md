# Uploading Resumes

Supported formats: `PDF`, `DOCX`.

Tips:

- Ensure your resume includes a clear contact block at the top.
- Use bullet points for experience entries so parsing extracts them accurately.
- Remove decorative headers/footers that may confuse the parser.

If parsing fails, try exporting your resume to PDF again or use the editor to correct fields.
