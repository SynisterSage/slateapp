# Resumes: Editor & Revisions

The Resumes section is where you manage files, edit parsed content, and keep versions.

## Uploading

- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX. Use the Upload Resume action from the Resumes page.
- Uploads are scanned and parsed; you will see a progress indicator while parsing completes.

## Editor Overview

- The editor presents your resume as structured fields: Personal Info, Experience (items), Education, Skills, and Summary.
- Each experience item can be expanded to edit bullets, dates, and company details.
- Use the 'Create Revision' action before making major edits so you can roll back.

## Revisions

- Each save creates a revision entry with a timestamp. You can compare versions or restore a previous revision.
- Use revisions to A/B test different resume versions for job applications.

## Best Practices

- Keep the summary concise (2-3 lines) and focus bullets on achievements and results (quantified where possible).
- Use consistent date formats (YYYY-MM or Month Year) to improve parsing reliability.
